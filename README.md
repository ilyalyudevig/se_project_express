# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project for the WTWR (What to Wear?) application. This project focuses on creating a server for the application. Through this project, we work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

The technology stack is as follows:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Mongoose.js
- MongodDB

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
